/*
In JavaScript, the concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays together, 
creating a new array that contains the elements of the original arrays. 
It does not modify the original arrays; instead, it returns a new array with the 
concatenated elements.

The syntax for the concat() method is as follows:

const newArray = array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayN);

Here, array1 is the initial array, and array2, array3, ..., arrayN 
are the arrays you want to concatenate. You can pass multiple arrays 
separated by commas, and they will be merged in the order they appear 
in the arguments list.
