/*
The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that the function is
executing in. The value of this is determined by how a function is invoked,
and it may vary depending on the context.
*/

//  There are four common ways to set the value of this:

//  1.  Global context:
/* When this is used in the global scope (outside of any function),
it refers to the global object, which is typically window in a browser or global in Node.js. */

//  2.  Function context:
/* When a function is invoked as a method of an object, this is set to the object itself. */
//  For example:

let obj = {
    name: 'Karoly',
    greet: function () {
        console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
    },
};

obj.greet(); // Output: Hello, Karoly!

//  3.  Explicit binding:
/*You can explicitly set the value of this by using functions like call(), apply(), or bind().*/
// For instance:

function greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
}

const person = { name: 'Alice' };

greet.call(person); // Output: Hello, Alice!
